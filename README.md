# Bubble Layout

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


I wanted to port part of the [Bubble Layout](https://codepen.io/sol0mka/pen/yNOage) to React :

And check if I could use it in my portfolio.

As the revert of my first merge indicates, integrating this layout within a scroll layout is a pretty bad idea

## Done
  - [x] bubbles growing as the layout is scrolled

## Todo

- [ ] the page system
- [ ] add mobile touch and tap event support
- [ ] Find an alternative to the Iscroll package

## Caveats

- I did not reproduce the sound effects 
- I did not reproduce the blob effect at the beggining
